Hot tip - you must pre book your ticket on line or with your hotel to avoid long queues on arrival. It's one thing reading about this ancient site or learning about it in school but to actually visit it is fantastic. This was the highlight of our 6 day stay in Rome.

Buy your tickets online, then once there, pay the money to join a tour group that allows you to skip the usually very long lines, Once inside, drop the tour group and explore on your own. There are self-guided audio tours available for a small fee inside, so enjoy at your own pace!

12 euros for the colloseum and the Forum really good value.
Watch the skip the line offers outside. Double the price to avoid the 45 minute queue - which turned out to be a 5 minute queue!!

You can almost smell the food cooking over an ancient fire mixed with smell of 80000 romans and the fear and blood of the animals and people in the arena. I don't think a tour guide...

It is simply stunning. If you are not in awe after seeing this, something is wrong with you. On a side note, the process of visiting is pretty streamlined so you will get in relatively quick.

Get a tour guide for sure. They save you a LOT of time by getting your tickets in advance. Make sure your guide does that so you don't have to stand on line. Get there as early as possible. It gets extremely crowded by 10am. Plan on a two hour tour or more. It is very impressive

Buy your tickets at the fora Romano, skip most of the queue. Head into the left lane from there and don't get conned by tour guides. Its only a brief history lesson that you could Google yourself and they don't show u around.

The Pantheon is an engineering marvel. It is a must see building in Rome. Also very close to Piazza Navona. There are crowds but still amazing to stand under the dome and realize it was constructed almost 2000 years ago!

It's one of Rome's highlights.
Originally built as a Roman temple, later converted into a catholic church, the Pantheon is definitely worth a visit.
Beautifully decorated inside, but the most impressive is the dome with a central skylight.
Entrance is free. the Pantheon is closed for public during services.
The surroundings are also lovely, beware that the bars and restaurants...

The Pantheon is a must-see in Rome. The dome/ceiling is incredible - and it was built around 100AD (AMAZING!) The circular 'oculus' at the top of the dome serves as the only light in the building - which is also amazing how much light it provides. Free to get in and great gelato places nearby.

St John Lateran fell into ruin and was almost entirely rebuilt in the 18th century. I'm a massive history buff but even I've got to say - it's a 15 minute visit and then find something...

Rome is busy and noisy, but there are quiet places that indulge the senses and bring quiet to the soul. Arcibasilica di San Giovanni in Laterano is just such a place. Being off the tourist path, The Basilica offers space, time and opportunity to truly study art and architecture without the crowds, and to pray.

This is the Pope's Church in Rome. It is a 4th century Basilica and it serves the Diocese of Rome as the Cathedral. Many Americans will refer to this church as St John Lateran.

Obviously, St. Peter's is the most dramatic and beautiful of Rome's churches; but San Giovanni has a style and a history quite as compelling. The statues of the apostles alone are well worth the visit. Much quieter and perhaps more reverent than St. Peter's, this should be high on your Rome-sights list.

Beautiful Basilica, watch out for the pickpockets out by the restaurants. You can easily spend a half day taking pictures and attending Masses. You are outside the walls of Ancient Rome, so make sure you have transportation back to city center before you go there. The bus service is spotty at best and never trust the cabs.

This is a wonderful place to learn about Roman life of 2000 years ago. The modern 3d effects are quite useful. My only complaint is that walking around glass floors in the semi dark can be a bit dis-equilibrilizing---not for the faint hearted. Also there should be a small booklet of explanation for the cost of this museum

Le Domus Romane is extremely well done. From reading their own website and Tripadvisor reports, we weren't entirely sure what to expect. There is a medieval house built on the ruins of a grand Roman house which has been excavated (leaving the house above intact). There is a quite a bit of archaeology to see, including parts of the baths,...

This is not your average museum or archeological site. Sitting below a govt. office, these are underground excavations of a ""domus"" or wealthy roman home. Using sound and image projections, the visiting group travels around the underground archelogical site that comprises several ancient rooms including thermal baths. Surprising finale.
Do not miss it! the experience is very unique.

This place is hidden past the inner courtyard of a government building. It's rather hard to find, but if you go left from where Del Corso meets Piazza Venezia and look for a door in what looks to be a solid brick fortress with a coat of arms hanging on top, that should be it.

The church was built in the 5th century. It is so impressive -- even more impressive, perhaps, than St Peters because Santa Maria Maggiore stands more by itself. The mosaics within the church are centuries old -- some from the 5th century. One of the few places in Rome where you can see early medieval art in situ.

The Renaissance gave it a new coffered ceiling and Baroque brought its imposing front. The church is most famous for its mosaics. I don't remember this for sure, but I think this is one of the churches...

The ceiling alone is worth the trip. They were holding a mass, and just to hear the echo of the priest in Latin was divine. We are not Catholic, but we could still quietly observe the service as we surveyed the beauty of the church. There was no line or huge crowd, which made it all the better.

Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places I have visited in the world.
If you go to Rome do not miss this amazing place.
One tip, not worth doing guided tour, the place is very large and is much more expensive with the guide, if you buy the ticket over the Internet will pay 20 euros.

The most impressive thing about this church is its sheer size, only smaller than St. Peter's and somehow with cleaner, clearer lines. The negative side of this is the obvious newness which somehow doesn't fit with the rest of Rome.

San Paolo fuori le Mura can be reached by Metro Line B (Laurentina) and stop at San Paolo and you will find the Abbazia infront of you. Do visit the museum for an extra €6. If you like chocolate do purchase some from the souvenir shop. This chocolate is done by the priests from the Trappist Monastery outside Rome.

One thing about Rome, there is no shortage of churches. This was interesting for its Eastern Orthodox inspired Mosaics, but otherwise just an ornate box with bones in it.

Centro storico is absolutely magical, especially in the evenings. It is a must-see, and I recommend finding a hotel in this area if possible. It was fabulous to step out of our hotel and be smack-dab in the center of Rome's history.

Easy to reach from all areas of Rome. If you enjoy people watching this is the place to go. Find a bench and enjoy the view. Many pleasant and friendly people that enjoy sharing their experiences. Truly a must visit. Trasportation by bus or taxi is always easy to find.

This is a beautiful gallery. Be advices you only have 2 hours to explore and it is best to make reservations. When we were there on a Friday, the next reservation was for Tuesday the following week.

St. Ignatius is buried here; he's the founder of the Jesuit order of priests, called the Society of Jesus. This church is not dazzling like other Roman churches but heavily ornate--purposefully so in the baroque gilded style.

Stumbled across this little jewel wandering around. Lavishly decorated. Great ceiling fresco emphasizing architectural perspective! There is no center dome but instead a round black canvas painted tromp l'oeil to resemble one! Also, do not miss the Ludovisi tomb to the right of the altar. Notice the way the marble is done to look like flowing draperies!

One of the most beautiful churches in Rome... the roof is just extraordinary... up there with the greats! Its also a wonderful place to reflect, pray, and slow down from the hectic pace of travel and sight seeing. Also, if you are here on a Sunday, just down the road toward the Corso, is a beautiful little Chapel called Carravita......

Went to many churches in Rome - how could you not? This one, with it's peculiar dome-like ceiling, really win us over.
We stood there for a moment, staring at this ""dome"" before realising it is a flat surface, using perspective from under the main fresco, to make it look like a dome - loved it!

We wandered in on a whim and it was magnificent. So beautiful, and music playing, and so many people praying. Still decorated for Christmas when we were there, so we got to see the AMAZING nativity scene, complete with lights and running water.

The plain exterior hides a gorgeous Baroque interior with impressive 3D frescoes. Even a ""false dome"". Close to Pantheon but on a quiet street. Go while the sun is shining to get the best view of the paintings. Free. Photos and quiet talking are allowed. During services portions of church are off limits. We liked it better than St Peters....

Possibly the most fantastic church in Rome. Much more interesting than St. Peter's. Not too crowded, free, centrally located.

Many people don't bother going here as its not one of the so called ""top attractions"". Well you have to go just for the ceiling and ""false dome"" painting.

The roof, painted by Pozzo, gives the Sistine Chapel a run for its money! Don't give money to the guy on the door - I'm sure it's a scam. There are donation boxes inside. For Ignatian spiritualists, knowing the remains of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga are here, is very moving.

You have to put this 17th century church on in the middle of your path as you must get inside to fully absorb what this Church offers - it usually closes at 7PM (as any other church) but worth Googling for it just in case.
The strongest points are
- no fees (as any other normal church!)
- wheelchair access...

Not a square but rectangular plaza. Should have more of these around but unfortunately most of the piazzas are now used as car parks rather than for human gatherings away from the madding traffic as drivers here are mad!
Take your photos and move...

This piazza is featured in so many films. With Bellini fountains and architecture to inspire. Artists make this place come alive and dusk is magical. Small roads bring you to the most beautiful piazza.

After visiting the Trevi Fountain and finding it without water and under maintenance, the fountain in the Piazza Navona was a great sight to see. It kind of made up for the Trevi Fountain. It is a lovely square with a market atmosphere. Don't sit on the fountain, as you will be moved on by the police.

This piazza is so full of life and fun to be in...linger here a bit - the fountain is relaxing to sit around and watch people, the local artists surround the one end along with performers, and the ""pick pockets"" are mixed all around so beware! It's just light and open - don't pass this up!

Piazza Navona was the first place we went to when we arrived in Rome and it put the bar rather high, beautiful scenery wise.
Be sure to visit the piazza Navona during the daytime as well as night.
At night you have to explore the streets around the square and discover the nice restaurants, bars and nightlife.

Like all tourists we saw many churches while in Italy. This church was different, though. This is not just a church but an archaeological site. There are four different buildings, built one atop the other. Our sons, ages 14 and 11 were captivated as well.

we have truly been impressed by it. The church we see today has been erected over an ancient temple of Mithras. The building has three levels: the medieval church, built over a 4th century basilica, built over a Mithraeum that dates back to the 1st century AD.

You can see how statuary remains were incorporated into the walls, the remains of a pre-Christian feast site, and an underground spring-fed water system....

In this church, you can descend through the centuries as you move down to each level; from today to the 14 th, to the 10th and all the way down to the 1 st century, moving among the archaeological discoveries, and ultimately to a Roman Customs House. Frescoes are impressive.

If you've been to Rome before and seen the Sistine Chapel, the Colosseum, and the Forum, this should be your next destination. Not only does San Clemente have really lovely mosaics and inlaid floors, but there are two subterranean levels that help you understand how Rome really did get built up over the centuries. The archaeological levels (5 euro charge)...

Just go. Don't read too much about it beforehand. Everything is explained on signs.
Note:
- Don't give $ to people holding out baskets. They are beggars.
- Don't ignore 'no photography' rules. It makes you a jerk. Just enjoy your time and photos will be the last thing on your mind.

If you have got more than three days in Rome, consider buying a ticket (combi ticket with Colosseum) and spend a few hours at the Forum.
Impressive is to see (mostly) imagine how the old Rome must have looked.
A bit disappointing is that you're walking between ruins, or even less than that.

Interesting history. You can see the old Roman structures and get a sense of how things would have been back in the day. You can see the Colosseum and the National Monument to Victor Emmanuel II from the top of the Roman Forums. Pretty interesting.

Roman Forum was originally built as a marketplace; now, it is a square surrounded by the ruins of ancient governmental buildings. Back then, many public events took place here - elections, criminal trials, and commercial affairs. Visiting the forum (as well as all other ancient buildings in Rome) gave me a great feeling, as these ruins have been here forever!!...

We lived not too far from the Forum. If you want to learn more history, you have to join the tour and listen to the story. We just read enough about the places not to do any formal tours. Very interesting to just see and feel those places. Huge impact on everyone's intellectual capacity.

There are really buildings left of the Forum -- the building materials were cannibalized for centuries to create other edifices throughout Rome. But walking from the Capitoline Museum (and visiting Marcus Aurelius and Constantine there) down to the Colosseum and then finally to the Column of Trajan… that walk, through several arches and hundreds of columns, can give you an...

Actually many aspects of visiting the Forum are a bit disappointing. Many of the ruins/building do not have signs; what signs they have often jump into boring details of architecture and excavation instead of telling how the item was relevant in the Roman world; and places are often blocked for renovation/construction. Despite these challenges the Forum is amazing. Our Western...

We headed here thinking it would be a quick trip after hitting the Colosseum. How wrong we were. Hours later and still not having seen everything, we walked out. Tired but delighted to have spent time here. The history is amazing, the archaeological sites varied and covering multiple centuries. Very worth visiting, but give yourself plenty of time.

The Palatine Hill is within striking range of many other Roman sites, so it's no inconvenience to visit. Unfortunately, as others have noted, walking can be difficult. I don't recommend it for the mobility challenged/disabled/elderly. I recommend you book a tour through City Wonders FKA Dark Rome to bypass lines for this and the Roman Forum/Colosseum.

Definitely worth going here before the collessium and buy your tickets for both. You get to see the ruins of the forum but climb up and you get to see beautiful site of the ruins.

If you didn't buy your ticket in advance, we recommend you to start your visit by those attractions before going to the Colosseo (the three are included in the same ticket) to avoid its huge lines.

We did our tour of Palatine Hill with the tour group Through Eternity. Very good - especially for our 2 kids. Vanessa helped them remember what was there, what was going on at the time and made it interesting for them. Well worth the time to see this beautiful area, but I would highly recommend visiting with the tour group!

This little out of the way church has an original statue of Moses by Michelangelo himself! That, in itself, is amazing because there are hardly any crowds here and you get an unobstructed view of this beautiful piece of art. The basilica is beautiful and worth viewing. It contains the ""chains that bound St. Peter in captivity"". Definitely worth seeing.

One of the great things about visiting the churches in Rome (aside from any spiritual/religious enjoyment you may get out of it) is that there's always something interesting to see. This particular church contains two such things:

2)Michelangelo's impressive and imposing statue of Moses. This guy means business.

We tracked down this church to see Michelangelo's Moses and the chains that legend has it held St. Peter in prison. Reached by an amazing entry up a set of stairs you really feel the history as you approach it. The church itself is amazing and holds many other interesting and unique statues and artwork.

Beautiful cathedral,albeit off the tourist trail. Marvellous Baroque architecture,sumptuous paintings and ornamentation. A beautiful garden and of ofcourse the main attraction for devout Catholics,the remains of St. Peter are buried there,along with a fragment of the chain, that had been used to bind and torture him.

The church is located near the Colosseum. From via Cavour there are some stairs (direction East) that lead up to the piazza in front of the church. A bit tricky to find it, but it is worth the visit. The church is a simple one (compared to Laterano, Maggiore or Vatican's St Peter) but it is home to Michelangelo's Moses...

This church is nothing special in itself and it is also quite difficult to find because it´s a bit hidden in the labrynth that is the city of Rome, up on a hill, near the Via dei Fori Imperiali, the avenue that runs between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum.

We had just passed by the Colosseum when our local friend stopped here. Apart from being a beautiful church with all it's amazing architecture it also has the added benefit of holding amongst its treasures St. Peter's chains and Michelangelo's Moses. It motivates me to revisit the history of many of these pieces and their legacy, especially for Catholics.

We went to see the beautiful statue of Moses. Up a steep hill from the Colosseum. Need to turn on the lights for one Euro to really see the detail. The chains are also on display.

A quick stop on the way to the Colosseum, we got off the metro, popped in to this church for ten minutes, then left. We got to see both Michelangelo's Moses, and the chains that bound St Peter when he was in Rome - all for free. Super easy!

The church inside is beautiful , and you can see the chains of Saint Peter displayed in an urn. In this church also you can admire the Moises of Michel Angelo. Remember the churches in Italy are closed at noon and reopened at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

Although the Moses sculpture by Michelangelo may be the main reason most tourists visit this Basilica, more treasured by Romans are the chains that are said to have bound St. Peter when he was imprisoned in Jerusalem, and brought to Rome by St. Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great. They are well displayed in a glass case beneath the...

San Pietro is not on the beaten track but it's easy enough to get to-close to the Colosseo tram stop and the hill from there. The church is free and the Michelangelo sculpture is in the rear of the basilica. This massive assemblage was intended for Pope Julius II's tomb but he wasn't happy with it. Even in good daylight...

End of day, the kids and adults are churched out and it is starting to rain. The decision is to walk up the massive flight of steps from Via Giovanni Lanza or just skip it. I'm sure glad we didn't skip it. The church was impressive, but the Chains of St. Peter, the Michelangelo statues and the other vaults in...

The San Pietro in Vincoli, or St. Peter in Chains, is definitely worth visiting. It is a lesser-known basilica in Rome, but nonetheless impressive. This Roman Catholic chuch is best known for being the home of Michelangelo's statue of Moses, part of the tomb of Pope Julius II.

The church isn't especially spectacular except for Michaelangelo's tomb of Pope Julius II. He often considered this sculpture of Moses to be his best work, and referred to the scaled down tomb (originally meant for St Peter's Basilica but put on hold for the painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) as the Tragedy of the Tomb. However Moses and the...

The two things to see here are apparently Michelangelo's Moses and the chains that once held St Peter. Moses is incredibly impressive, although you have to pay 1 euro to turn on the light that illuminates it.
There was no way that I was going to pay a euro to turn a light on, but luckily so many tourists do...

Was beautiful and serene especially to see the chains and Moses. A sculpture that will blow you away. It is 2 Euros for the audio guide and well worth it. YOu will not have context to the place if you dont listen to it so please do.

This church is in a hiiden street close to the Colosseum. The treasure in the church is definitely the statue of Moses. The details in this statue will leave you awestruck and gawking. Definitely see it under the lights by dropping in a Euro. You will not be dissapointed

The best part of Peter in Chains was the Moses sculpture. It's worth the euro you have to spend to turn the light on. The sculpture has so much movement in it....amazing.

This Church is located on a hill so you will have to climb many steps to reach it but it is absolutely a must see when in Rome. Michelangelo's Moses is magnificent and a art lover will absolutely just look at it in awe. The church is quiet and very beautiful. Enjoy an afternoon waling in this Church and Enjoy....

This is the church which houses the relics of the chains that bound Saint Peter when he was imprisoned in Jerusalem and later in Rome. The chains magically fused together when presented. If you're a Christian, it's boggling to think that those chains may have been touched by angels.
