A must see!!! Fantastic architecture from the roman times! Very cool area to check our surrounding it also.

My husband and I walked past the colosseum, it was so packed with tourists. We didn't even stop to take pictures. There are a lot of very large walking tours in Rome and honestly they just get in the way. I couldn't even stop to enjoy this attraction.
",Sooooo crowded!

This is the most awesome piece of history I've ever seen in my whole life. You can walk around it as long as you like. They also have very good guides at different times during the day. For only 5€ it's totally worth it.

We had two days in Rome. This is a must see. Simply amazing architecture considering that a was built so long ago. We booked a tour which was very good and helped us to avoid long lines and individuals trying to sell you things.

Went to the Colosseum told a look a the queues and left again could have bought jump the queues tickets but had already had a couple of girls try to pick my pockets on the metro been ripped of by cafes that price things at take away prices and then are doubled if you drink in. And had the ""marketing...

One can never been senseless when facing such piece of history. It is a fantastic monument, we can walk around the corridors and imagine how it would be to be there in a sold out Colosseum with nearly 70.000 people. But with little imagination, we can also think on the suffering and paine of those used to amuse the crowds....

Cool experience but maybe not worth waiting in a really really long line. Get the audio tour, otherwise, not worth the walk around the inside. We didn't do a guided tour and that might be where the value lines. The audio tour does explain quite a bit. A little confusing/difficult to navigate around the tour groups (outside companies) who are...

This colosseum is a must see attraction that's what is said but unfortunately even though we had been at the door step we did not enter as it was very very crowded and the heat was at it's peak even to get in to take ticket through tour group which is better and faster we would have had to spend...

We bought a tour ahead of time and SO glad we did! We were told to and understand why... The lines are huge. And if you don't have a ticket ahead of time you will waste so much time.
Find any tour, too. Whatever is most affordable. You're going for the view and can look it up if you have...

I highly recommend buying tickets online!!! It's the coloseum, even if you had a layover in Rome for 1/2 day, you'd want to try to see this, it's worth it. There's even a subway stop right across the street.

We knew some bit of Colosseum history from books and movies already. Still we chose to take a guided tour to know a bit more, which didn't end up well. The guide couldn't provide anything new. I would suggest to visit this place yourselves taking some time. You can read all the information on the boards inside. You will know...

You know all about it and have seen all the pictures but it still delivers an amazing experience.
12 euros for the colloseum and the Forum really good value.
Watch the skip the line offers outside. Double the price to avoid the 45 minute queue - which turned out to be a 5 minute queue!!

If you read up a bit of ancient history (even fiction) it feels as if history comes alive around you at this ancient site. You can almost smell the food cooking over an ancient fire mixed with smell of 80000 romans and the fear and blood of the animals and people in the arena. I don't think a tour guide...

A must see. Gives an excellent perspective on what life was like during the Roman Era. Many other things to see around the area. Plan ahead to spend at least a day in the area.

Of course it's 5 stars!! I'm not even sure why it would need a review. It won't disappoint. I'm not sure why anyone buys tickets at the coleseum. Buy the combo ticket at the forum (no line); see the Palestine hill and the forum (they are great as well). Then go straight to the prepaid line at the coleseum. There...

So incredible to see in real life! Absolutely amazing. I didn't go inside but next time I'm in Rome I will.

To walk through and touch the Colosseum is amazing. Our tour guide Francesca is an archeologist who has undertaken excavations on site and her passion was contagious.

The Colosseum is an amazing piece of work. Hard to imagine the construction of this monumental piece of architecture in the age it was build! Make it a point to see this if you're ever in Rome.

Visited the Colosseum on the first Sunday in September and that allowed me free entry also to Palantine Hill and the Roman Forum.
I spent around 1-2 hours roaming these historical sites.
The queues were long but literally took me 10 minutes to gain entry.
It's an awesome place which opened my eyes to history at that time.

As most others have reported, incredible from an architectural, engineering and historical perspective. Really worth seeing. Wife and I hade a Roma pass and we turned up around 0830 (today 22/9/15) & it was still fairly quiet, best time to be at these places. Not sure what one of the commenters below was reporting about not opening until 1100 though...

This is an awesome place, pro's the inside is just fantastic the information is set out well and you really do get a feel for what it was like.

Take your age ID if under 25 as my kids for reduced entry fee. Tour is a waste of money. Audio guide pretty pathetic. Busy but impressive building, a generally Rome handbook will give you the info you need

Magnificent and magical, you can actually feel the history, its bigger than you think. Go later in the day its quieter, we also had a guide, well worth it.

We visted in peek time and found it ok and easy enough with 3 kids, it was beautiful inside and Luke all of Rome it has amazing architecture. Watch out for the hawkers with there selfie sticks, they are very annoying.

Last year i visited Rome and saw the Colloseum, but alas it was closed due to works being carried out so decided to walk around it , as you look at its structure you see holes, these were where the fixing were for marble which over the years had been stolen.

Amazing stills. One of the best attractions of the world. Italy without Colosseum is nothing. Do visit this place and buy passes in advance. Also beware of pick-pocketers.

Although u need to pay for this attraction, it is a sure win for everyone. It's an amazing structure that must be seen and with 12€ u get to do it. Lining up to get a ticket for this does not take long and it's really fast.
All in all, lovely attraction and there is 2 gift shops too.

Purchase your tickets in advance to beat the long queues, it is worth paying that little bit extra as you will be fast tracked to the front and in the 36 degrees heat in September it is worth it. Once inside you can spend the whole day there if you choose. Breath-taking and the history and structure of the Colosseum...

I bought the official tour for the third ring and the underground, and the experience was great. It is the only way to access this parts, and I didn't found it expensive (9€). Book it in advance, or you won't be able to enter.

Amazing place to visit - you can't visit Rome without seeing this! I recommend pre-booking your tickets to avoid the long queues and walking round at you leisure rather than booking a tour guide.
",Amazing - Not to be missed

Admiration of the Roman Empire engineering achievements. We learned about the fact that most gladiators stayed alive after the fights as the Caesars invested a lot in the gladiators schools. Another surprise was that chirurgy and orthopedic medicine advanced dramatically due to the gladiators doctors.

The most incredible and breathtaking place I've ever visited. It was busy which was to be expected.
We prebooked the excursion in the UK and had to pick up the tickets nearby. We went at lunchtime and our allocated slot was 4pm. This was on a Monday.
Buy the fast pass tickets! Or you will spend the whole day in...

Loved the experience. Fab building, so old, so much history.
pay for a audio guide, worth learning more about the activities, people, history of the place.

Colosseum has a lot of character to it and its like a symbol of rome. Worth taking the Audio guide available in different language and one must read a bit of its history. That would give an added feel to enjoy it.

It meets all your expectations. It is amazing. I would strongly recommend seeing the colosseum. It is worth while paying extra and getting skip the line passes. The crowds are huge. Bring water because they charge you approx $20 for a bottle of water.
